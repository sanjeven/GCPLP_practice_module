"Super Singapore Chicken Rice Steps: 1) Cut off the chickens legs and wings. Store for later. 2) Fill a pan big enough to fit the whole chicken, halfway with water. And add the stock cube and half of the ginger. 3) Bring to a boil and add the chicken without it's limbs. 4) Cover and let cook over medium heat for max. 20 minutes. Not too long or it'll be dry. 5) Take out the chicken and leave it covered to cool slowly. If it wasn't totally cooked when it came out of the pan, the residual heat will do it in the time it takes to complete the next few steps. 6) Take out the ginger and cook the rice in the broth leftover from the chicken. This is the secret to great chicken rice. Cooking the rice in this broth will make it really tasty and a little oily, just the way you want it. 7) For the sauce, grind up all the ingredients and add more of each to taste. Its supposed to be fiery hot! I add the mirin for a little sweetness. 8) When the rice is done, drain and let sit covered. 9) Sharpen your best knife and place the chicken on your cutting board. 10) To cut perfect breasts off a chicken you need to find the spine. Place your knife in the center of the chicken and push down slightly. The knife will slide off of one side of the spine and this is the side you will be cutting first. Slowly start cutting down and try to feel where the ribs are. Stay as close as possible to them without cutting through. The head side will come off first and you can get a better grip for the last bit. Be careful with the skin though, you want it to stay on. Repeat on the other side and you're done. 11) Cut the chicken breasts slantwise into pieces about 1 cm or 1/2 inch thick. 12) Chop up the spring onion and either stir through the rice or sprinkle over later as garnish. 13) Slice the cucumber into thin strips. 14) To fix the plate fill a small bowl with rice and tip it over like making a sandcastle. This will give you a perfect dome of rice. Next to that place you perfectly sliced chicken. Place the strips of cucumber next to the chicken. Serve the sauce in separate bowls for dipping. 1 for the chili sauce and another for the soy sauce. 15) Enjoy! 16) Add the leftover sauce to the legs and wings in a plastic bag and store in the fridge overnight. Add more if necessary. Stick in the oven for 25 minutes at 160C or 320F and enjoy again!
