    "instructions": "Put kecap manis, oyster sauce, sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl, stir, then set aside.\nPull back the apron of each crab, remove top shell, then intestines and feathery gills. Rinse quickly.\nCut each crab into quarters and crack the legs gently (I use a meat mallet) so the flavours can enter.\nHeat the oil in a very large wok over high heat; add the crab pieces and stir fry in batches until the shell is bright orange and the meat almost cooked (about 5 minutes). Remove and repeat until all is cooked.\nAdd the butter, ginger, garlic, chilli, black and white peppers and coriander to the wok; stir fry 30 seconds.\nAdd the sauce mixture and stir; bring to the boil, then simmer 2 minutes.\nReturn the crab to the wok and toss to coat in the sauce.\nCook a further 2-3 minutes to finish cooking the crab then garnish with the spring onions and coriander leaves.\nServe at once.",
