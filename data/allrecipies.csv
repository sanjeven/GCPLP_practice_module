The Singapore Sling was created at Raffles Hotel at the turn-of-the-century by Hainanese-Chinese bartender, Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon.
In the Hotel's museum, visitors may view the safe in which Mr. Ngiam locked away his precious recipe books, as well as the Sling recipe hastily jotted on a bar-chit in 1936 by a visitor to the Hotel who asked the waiter for it.
Originally, the Singapore Sling was meant as a woman's drink, hence the attractive pink colour. Today, it is very definately a drink enjoyed by all, without which any visit to Raffles Hotel is incomplete.

Bring to a boil and add the chicken without it's limbs.
Cover and let cook over medium heat for max. 20 minutes. Not too long or it'll be dry.
Take out the chicken and leave it covered to cool slowly. If it wasn't totally cooked when it came out of the pan, the residual heat will do it in the time it takes to complete the next few steps.
Take out the ginger and cook the rice in the broth leftover from the chicken. This is the secret to great chicken rice. Cooking the rice in this broth will make it really tasty and a little oily, just the way you want it.
For the sauce, grind up all the ingredients and add more of each to taste. Its supposed to be fiery hot! I add the mirin for a little sweetness.
When the rice is done, drain and let sit covered.
Sharpen your best knife and place the chicken on your cutting board.
To cut perfect breasts off a chicken you need to find the spine. Place your knife in the center of the chicken and push down slightly. The knife will slide off of one side of the spine and this is the side you will be cutting first. Slowly start cutting down and try to feel where the ribs are. Stay as close as possible to them without cutting through. The head side will come off first and you can get a better grip for the last bit. Be careful with the skin though, you want it to stay on. Repeat on the other side and you're done.
Cut the chicken breasts slantwise into pieces about 1 cm or 1/2 inch thick.
Chop up the spring onion and either stir through the rice or sprinkle over later as garnish.
Slice the cucumber into thin strips.
To fix the plate fill a small bowl with rice and tip it over like making a sandcastle. This will give you a perfect dome of rice. Next to that place you perfectly sliced chicken. Place the strips of cucumber next to the chicken. Serve the sauce in separate bowls for dipping. 1 for the chili sauce and another for the soy sauce.

Spinach Noodles Recipe (Healthy Homemade Noodles),"Making fresh noodles at home is easier and much more efficient with a noodle maker, no kneading is needed.
Wash and clean spinach, bring a pot of water to boil, and cook the spinach for 2 minutes until slightly wilted and tender.
Drain the cooked spinach, rinse off in cold water to stop the cooking, squeeze out any excess water with hand. Try to get rid of as much water as possible.
Add in 50g water, ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp baking soda, puree using immersion blender or food processor until fine.
Mix pureed spinach with flour to form dry stiff dough.
Use a hand-crank noodle maker to roll out the stiff dough into thick sheet. Use widest setting, fold the dough over and roll again, repeat the process few times until the dough start to come together. I alternate between 7 and 5 setting on the machine, 7 being widest setting.
Repeat the process as many times as you wish until a smooth and even color dough is formed.
Cover and rest the dough sheet for 15 minutes.
After resting the dough for 15 minutes, feed the dough to the machine and roll into desired thickness depending on personal preferences and type of noodles being make.
Cut noodles into shape using the noodle maker attachment.
If you are not cooking the fresh noodles immediately, air dried for 10-30 minutes and store in refrigerator for later use. Keep frozen for up to 3 months, refrigerate for 3-5 days or sun dried and keep in airtight container at room temperature for 1-3 months.
Cook fresh noodles for 3-4 minutes, drain and rinse with cold water, add in broth/soup or stir in noodle sauce. Dried noodles require longer time to cook, add 2-3 minutes of additional cooking time. Cooking time may vary depend on the thickness and how you cut your noodles.
Stir frying: Boil the noodles until it is slightly undercook but firm to bite, drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, toss it with some oil and set aside for stir-fry.","['200 g all-purpose flour', '50 g spinach', '50 g water', '½ tsp salt', '¼ tsp baking soda']"
