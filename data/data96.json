    "instructions": "Making fresh noodles at home is easier and much more efficient with a noodle maker, no kneading is needed.\nWash and clean spinach, bring a pot of water to boil, and cook the spinach for 2 minutes until slightly wilted and tender.\nDrain the cooked spinach, rinse off in cold water to stop the cooking, squeeze out any excess water with hand. Try to get rid of as much water as possible.\nAdd in 50g water, ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp baking soda, puree using immersion blender or food processor until fine.\nMix pureed spinach with flour to form dry stiff dough.\nUse a hand-crank noodle maker to roll out the stiff dough into thick sheet. Use widest setting, fold the dough over and roll again, repeat the process few times until the dough start to come together. I alternate between 7 and 5 setting on the machine, 7 being widest setting.\nRepeat the process as many times as you wish until a smooth and even color dough is formed.\nCover and rest the dough sheet for 15 minutes.\nAfter resting the dough for 15 minutes, feed the dough to the machine and roll into desired thickness depending on personal preferences and type of noodles being make.\nCut noodles into shape using the noodle maker attachment.\nIf you are not cooking the fresh noodles immediately, air dried for 10-30 minutes and store in refrigerator for later use. Keep frozen for up to 3 months, refrigerate for 3-5 days or sun dried and keep in airtight container at room temperature for 1-3 months.\nCook fresh noodles for 3-4 minutes, drain and rinse with cold water, add in broth/soup or stir in noodle sauce. Dried noodles require longer time to cook, add 2-3 minutes of additional cooking time. Cooking time may vary depend on the thickness and how you cut your noodles.\nStir frying: Boil the noodles until it is slightly undercook but firm to bite, drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, toss it with some oil and set aside for stir-fry.",
