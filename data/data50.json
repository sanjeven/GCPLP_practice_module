Arrange the sates on the hot grate. Grill the sates until cooked to taste, 1 to 2 minutes per side for medium-rare, a little longer for medium.\nTo Make Singapore Cucumber Relish: Cut the cucumber into 1/4-inch dice. Place the cucumber, shallot, chile, rice vinegar and sugar in a mixing bowl and toss gently to mix. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The relish can be made up to 2 hours ahead.",
