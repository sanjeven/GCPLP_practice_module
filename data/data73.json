    "instructions": "Use 1 half-bird or 3 leg quarters chicken, about 1 kg, cut into small pieces, pat dry and marinate with ½ tsp salt for at least 1 hour, keep refrigerated if marinating period longer than an hour.\nUse half of the 300g grated coconut for toasting. Toast 150g grated coconut in a dry non-stick pan/wok over medium heat until golden brown, keep stirring. The cooking should take about 10-12 minutes. Color of the toasted coconut will turn slightly deeper when cooled.\nBlend the toasted coconut with a food processor, ground to fine or paste if you prefer. This can be made ahead and keep refrigerated.\nAdd the remaining 150g fresh grated coconut to a food processor, mix with 300g hot water (80°C-90°C), process until fine.\nPour the mixture onto a sieve, allow it to slightly cool down and squeeze out the coconut milk.\nCut, rinse, de-seed and drain dried chilies.\nCombine and thoroughly mix tamarind paste with some water and set aside.\nCut 1 slices of Lengkuas (Alpinia galanga), 4 Kaffir lime leaves, slice 2 turmeric leaves thinly and slightly smash 2 stalks lemongrass with the back of a heavy knife to release the flavor.\nCut onion, shallot and garlic into small chunks, this will help the food processor doing the chopping more easily.\nAdd in dried chilies, Candlenut, onion, shallot and garlic, process until fine with a food processor/blender. Mix in ginger powder and turmeric powder. Oil helps with the blending process; add just enough to blend all the ingredients.\nShallow fry the chicken with 4 to 5 tablespoons of oil, turn over the chicken meat partway, cook for about 6-8 minutes. Set aside.\nPour chili paste into cooking pan, add in Lengkuas (Alpinia galanga, blue ginger) and lemongrass, cook with medium heat for about 6-8 minutes until fragrant and oil separate from chili paste. Add in chicken to stir fry.\nCook for 10 minutes on medium heat, stir occasionally to avoid burning. Add in Kaffir lime leaves, coconut milk, tamarind water and toasted coconut, cook for another 10 minutes to reduce the sauce.\nMix in palm sugar and salt, stir in sliced turmeric leaf and turn off the heat. Scoop out floating fat if desired, the sauce will continue to thicken when cooled.\nSauce will continue to thicken, the taste of the meat will be richer and color will be darker after completely cooled.",
