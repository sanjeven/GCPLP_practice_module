    "instructions": "Heat 3 tablespoons oil, curry powder, and cayenne, if using, in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and set aside.\nBring 1½ quarts water to boil. Break rice noodles into thirds and place into a large bowl. Pour boiling water over noodles and stir briefly. Soak noodles until flexible, but not soft, about 2½ minutes, stirring once halfway through soaking. Drain noodles and add in the curry mixture, soy sauce and sugar; using tongs, toss until well combined. Set aside.\nWipe out skillet with paper towels. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add in shrimp in an even layer and cook without moving them until bottoms are browned, about 90 seconds. Stir and continue to cook until just cooked through, about 90 seconds longer. Push shrimp to 1 side of skillet. Add 1 teaspoon of oil to the cleared side of skillet. Add eggs to clearing and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon of salt. Using a rubber spatula, stir eggs gently until set but still wet, about 1 minute. Stir eggs into shrimp and continue to cook, breaking up large pieces of egg, until eggs are fully cooked, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer shrimp-egg mixture to a second large bowl.\nReduce heat to medium. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a now-empty skillet until shimmering. Add in garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add in bell pepper and shallots. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the shrimp and egg mixture.\nReturn skillet to medium-high heat, add broth to skillet, and bring to a simmer. Add noodles and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Add in the shrimp mixture and vegetable mixture and toss to combine. Add in the bean sprouts, green onions and lime juice, toss again until all of the mixture is well combined. Serve immediately with lime wedges. Serves 4 to 6 people.",
